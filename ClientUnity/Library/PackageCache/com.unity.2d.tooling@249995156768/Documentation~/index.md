# 2D Tooling package
This package provides different specialized tools designed to streamline workflow and improve efficiency when working with 2D games in Unity. This package currently only contains the [Sprite Atlas Analyzer](GetStarted-sprite-atlas-analyzer.md), which is a tool that displays detailed information on the sprite atlases in your project to help you identify potential performance problems.

Additional tools are planned for this package, to be developed in the future.

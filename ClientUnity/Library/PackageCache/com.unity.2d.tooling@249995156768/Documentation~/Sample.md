# Sprite Atlas Analyzer report samples
This package contains two samples that shows how to customize and add new reports to the Sprite Atlas Analyzer. Install these samples from the **Samples** tab in the **2D Tooling** Package Manager window:
* [Sample Sprite Atlas Report](sample-sprite-altas-analyzer-custom-report.md)
* [Sample Sprite Data source and Report](sample-sprite-altas-analyzer-custom-data-source.md)

The explanation of the sample reports and how to use them are also available in the `README.md` of the respective sample projects.

## Sample Sprite Atlas Report
This sample shows how to use the sprite atlas data source to create a custom report. **Note:** This sample uses the internal APIs from the package which are subject to change.

## Sample Sprite data source and report

This sample  shows how to create your own data source and a custom report that filters data from the new data source. In this sample, a new data source will collect information of all the sprites that are in the project and the report will show the number of vertices and polygon count of each sprite.

## Modifying generated Animator Controllers

The Aseprite Importer generates an Animator Controller if the Aseprite file contains more than one frame, the [Import Mode](ImporterFeatures#general) is set to **Animated Sprite**, and the **Animation Clip** checkbox is checked in the importer. This Animator Controller is Read-Only, meaning that it cannot be changed. To modify the Animator Controller, please see [the Importer FAQ](ImporterFAQ#how-to-make-changes-to-an-animator-controller).
